**Name:** Anna Zanchetta

**About Me:** My background is in Phisycs of the Atmosphere and Remote sensing, with applications to environmental studies (water management and desertification), spatial inequalities and sustainable transport. I am interested in anything maps and open source.
As a Turing Research Fellow, I am currenlty working on ML and Computer vision for buildings footprints detection in collaboration with HOT (Humanitarina Openstreetmap Team, see [repo](https://github.com/ciupava/fAIr-utilities)).


**Name:** Natalia Efremova

**About me** 
Senior Research Fellow for Environment and Sustainability. 50% Alan Turing, 50% Queen Mary University. Background: computer science, computer vision. Interested in: applications of satellite imagery for sustainable agriculture. 
In ATI, I'm currently working in [DeepSensor](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/deepsensor) project and PV forecasting project. Mostly working with Sentinel-2 and Planet imagery. Staring to work on the [EUMETSAT](https://www.eumetsat.int) imagery. [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=7SpjSG4AAAAJ&hl=en)

**Name:** John Francis

**About Me:** I am a Data Scientist in the Public Policy Programme. My background is in poltical science and geography. The majority of my work is around LLM applications in government, but I have one Turing project ongoing that involves mapping trees from [aerial imagery](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/satellite-and-aerial-imagery-government). I primarily work with OS imagery, Sentinel-2 data, and LiDAR point cloud data. Besides trees, i am very interested in the different ways image embeddings can be used to learn things about the built and natural environment.

**Name:** [Thijs van der Plas](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/research-associates/dr-thijs-van-der-plas)

**About me:** I am a Research Associate in the Environment & Sustainability programme. In my project, we work on integrating remote sensing data with (scarce) field observations of wildlife to map biodiversity at high resolution and precision. Before this, I worked with the Peak District NP to [map land cover](https://www.turing.ac.uk/about-us/impact/mapping-habitats-peak-district-national-park) at very high resolution. I work with optical remote sensing data (multispectral satellite imagery and aerial photography), computer vision methods and self-supervised/unsupervised methods to reduce annotation requirements.
